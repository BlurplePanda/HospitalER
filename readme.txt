HospitalER project - COMP103 Assignment 3
Completion/challenge version - HospitalERCompl.java
Simulates a hospital with different departments, and the arrival, wait, and treatment of patients.
The user is able to control various parameters in the simulation via the sliders on the left side of the window.
Please note the dimensions of sliders may be adversely affected if the user's screen or system app scale is too small.
(This is an issue with the ecs100 library & is easily avoided by the user enlarging the window / lowering their scale.)
